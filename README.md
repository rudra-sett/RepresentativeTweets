# RepresentativeTweets

This is a project that gathers tweets from Senators and/or members of the House of Representatives. It then allows a user to filter them by topic and generate wordclouds based on party.

The purpose of this is to capture differences in language between the parties on various topics. For now, it doesn't reveal anything we don't already know. However, in the future, I plan to create scatterplots that show how unified parties on are on certain topics, or perhaps if we can find smaller groups within each party, etc.

I think there's room for exploration with all of this data, so we'll see what happens.
